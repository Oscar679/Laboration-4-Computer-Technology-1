## Task 2 - Binary counter
# One button for increasing counter, one button for decreasing counter
# Note - Since I had already turned in the buttons I was given by my lab teacher I had to simulate the button functionality by manually connecting the wires. Hence the "buttons" were pressed several times and it looks quite strange.
